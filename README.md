### Screenshot.js

A browser extension that takes screenshots of the active tab. It is easy to use
with little to no learning curve. It respects your privacy and doesn't make any
network requests. Screenshots are kept for the duration of a browser session
and then lost unless you save them to disk.

The screenshots you have taken during a browser session can be viewed from
the extension, they can also be deleted or saved to disk. Screenshots are taken
in response to a key click (ctrl + shift + k), and a notification is shown every
time a screenshot is taken.

### Install

Install as an unpacked extension in developer mode, or kindly wait for it to
become available on the Chrome store.

### License
